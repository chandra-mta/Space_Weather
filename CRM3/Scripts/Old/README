The Chandra Radiation Model (CRM) from Sverdrup/MSFC
is propagated in this directory, and graphical and
tabular data products are updated every 5 minutes 
by cron jobs, to track current and future orbital 
proton flux and fluence.

crm.pl 
------
    runs at 5-minute intervals to track the planned SIM and 
    OTG positions, Kp, and the CRM model output, and to generate
    the orbital fluence history, both with and without SIM+OTG
    attenuation factors. crm.pl also runs the IDL procedure
    crmpl2.pro, which generates plots of predicted future 
    proton fluence.

    input:

    CRM_p.datNN     - proton flux data from CRM model, where NN = Kp*10 (eg 53 => 5.3)
                      (each CRM_p.datNN file contains:
                      time (seconds from 1998), CRM region, mean flux, 
                      95% flux, 50% flux, flux SD)
    
    fphist.dat      - simplified time sequence of Chandra SIM position,
                      currently derived from /proj/sot/acis/FLU-MON/FPHIST-2001.dat
                      (symbolic linked to it)
    
    grathist.dat    - simplified time sequence of Chandra OTG positions,
                      curently derived from /proj/sot/acis/FLU-MON/GRATHIST-2001.dat
                      (symbolic linked to it)

    output:
    
    CRMarchive.dat  - archive of Chandra orbital fluences
    
    CRMsummary.dat  - latest summary of Chandra proton flux and fluence

runcrm 
-------
    generate CRM fluxes at 5-minute intervals (corresponding 
    to the Chandra ephemeris positions in 
    /data/mta4/Space_Weather/ephem/PE.EPH.dat), 
    for the 28 possible Kp values from 0.0 to 9.0

    this script is run as a part of /data/mta4/Space_Weather/ephem/Scripts/ephem.pl

    input  -- /data/mta4/Space_Weather/ephem/Data/PE.EPH.gsme_in_Re

    output -- /data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRM3/Data/CRM_p.datNN

    >>> Binary data compatibility <<<
    ---------------------------------

        CRMFLX_V12_EXP.f needs three binary data files which are machine dependent.
        if you need to recompile runcrm.f on none linux machine, you need to do the following.
        
        1. go to linux machine (this version is complined on linux)

        2. compile SolWB2A.f and run it. this will create an ascii version
           (SolWB2A.f can be found in /data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRMFLX/CRMFLX_ver23a)

        3. go to a new machine/operaiton system.

        4. compile SolWA2B.f and run it. this will create a binary version 
           which can be read on the new machine.

        5. do same for two others. If you can't find a fortran program, specificlally
           to that data, just modify  SolWB2A.f and/or  SolWA2B.f

        The binary data files are:

            MSheath_Kp_PROT.BIN
            MSPH_Kp_PROT.BIN
            SolWind_Kp_PROT.BIN

        The ascii versions are already in:
            /data/mta4/Space_Weather/Data/

Plottting routines
--------------------
CRM_plots.idl           --- idl calling script. set the environment for the plot
rac_arread.pro          --- read data from a file into 1-D vectors
rac_arreadbl.pro        --- read data from a file into 1-D vectors
timeconv.pro            --- convert a time in seconds to year, day, hour, min, sec
crmpl2.pro              --- the main script to creates two plots (crmpl.gif, crmplatt.gif)

                            data needed:    /data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRM3/Data/CRMsummary.dat
                                            /proj/sot/acis/FLU-MON/FPHIST-2001.dat
                                            /proj/sot/acis/FLU-MON/GRATHIST-2001.dat
                                            /data/mta4/Space_Weather/ephem/Data/dsn_summary.dat
                                            /data/mta4/Space_Weather/ephem/Data/PE.EPH.gsme

convrt_to_fphist.perl   --- the script to convert FPHIST-2001.dat to fphist.dat so that
                            crmpl2.pro can use it. it was used to be done internally, but
                            FPHIST-2001.dat has a data gap and need to be handle the
                            problem outside of the idl script
