About ACE Monitoring 
</h2>


<a href="http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/acis/reb/OnRadiation.html"> ACIS Ops Response to Radiation Events</a><br />

<h3>The Science Operations Team has two proton monitoring systems.</h3>
<ol>
<li> <b>Orbit Monitor:</b>
  
    <p>
    The fluence of ACE protons in the 115-195 keV energy range is
    integrated over each Chandra orbit, while Chandra is above 70,000 km 
    geocentric distance. The fluence measurement is reset to 0 while
    Chandra is below 70,000 km.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
    via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
    fluence and the integrated time.
    </p>

    <p>
    The latest ACE proton flux, and the integrated fluence, are on the
    top line of the 
    Chandra snapshot </a>display (f_ACE and F_CRM respectively),
    and on the SOT's  <a href="./ace.html"> ACE page</a>.
    </p>
	
    <p>
    ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
    </p>
    <p>
    An open-ended series of thresholds,
    at 1E9, 3E9, 9E9, 27E9, 81E9, 243E9 etc.
    For each threshold, issue 3 alerts at 30 minute intervals,
    then increase threshold to next level.
    Reset orbit fluence to zero, and reset threshold to 1E9 
    at the end of each orbit.
    </p>

<li> <b>Two Hour Monitor:</b>

    <p style='color:#FF0000;margin-left:40px;margin-right:40px;'>
    <b> A violation of this limit is more serious than the orbital limit
    since it implies a similar flux in a shorter time scale.</h4> </font>
    </b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The fluence of ACE protons in the 115-195 keV energy range is
    integrated as a runing average over each 2 hour period.
    This is 24 measurments during each period.  Bad measurments are
    dropped and the average Flux particles/cm2-s-ster-MeV is calculated.
    <p>
    <p>
    If the fluence exceeds a threshold, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
    via pagers and via email. The alert message provides the measured
    fluence and the integrated time.
    </p>
    <p>
    ACE proton energy range: 130 - 214 keV
    </p>
    <p>
    Fluence threshold = 50,000 protons/cm2-s-ster-MeV average over a 2
    hour window (3.6e8 protons/cm2-ster-MeV).
    </p>
    <p>
    An ACE instrument swap occurred in February 2004.  The FP6p (761-1220 keV)
    channel stayed the same but the P3 channel (112-187 keV) changed somewhat.  
    Therefore we now alert first if the fluence derived from FP6p*36.0 
    is greater than 1.2e8 p/cm2-ster-MeV.  An alert is also sent if the new
    P3 channel (115-195 keV) exceeds 3.6e8 p/cm2-ster-MeV and P3/FP6f < 36.

        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
    Alert scheme: 1 alert. Once this alert
    triggers it is disabled for 24-48 hours or until manually rearmed by the 
    MTA scientist.

    A violation of this limit indicate the general
    radiation state near the Earth is high.</h4> </font>
    </p>

    <p>
    If the  value of Kp (projected) exceeds the threshold a
    yellow alert is generated, SOT and FOT members are alerted 
    via email and pager. The alert message provides the measured
    Kp, current S/C configuration and comm schedule.   The threshold is
    variable on a matrix of time (by month) and configuration (grating and sim 
    position).

    The latest ACE proton flux, the integrated fluence, and Kp are on the
    top line of the  
    <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/Snapshot/snap.cgi?action=Latest"> Chandra snapshot </a> 
    display (f_ACE, F_CRM and Kp respectively), and on the SOT's

<li><b><a name="RADMON"> Chandra RADMON trigger levels</a></b>

    <p>
    RADMON will trigger SCS 107 (SI safing) if ANY of the following three 
    EPHIN channels exceeds the on-board threshold for 10 consecutive samples.
    EPHIN samples are sent to the OBC each 65.6 seconds.
    </p>
    <pre style='margin-left:50px;'>

AS OF DEC 09, 2008:

- No discrimination among electrons, protons, and nuclei will be made
  - All four proton channels will show 0 counts
  - All four electron channels will become combinations of electrons, protons 
    and nuclei (e.g. the new E150 will be E150 + P4GM + H4GM)
- The overall geometric factor will be change but will be constant (i.e. it 
   will not toggle between large and small)
- The safing channels will be E150, E1300, HRC MCP Total Rate with the 
  following thresholds:

E150      800000 counts/sample
E1300       1000 counts/sample
MCP Total     30 counts/sample (the relevant MSID is 2DETART)


The previous thresholds (now obsolete) were:

     SSD-opening. Once that is done, this file will provide us with the
     observed ACE proton fluence for each orbit and for the mission to date
     (which we can compare against our budget of 2E10).
