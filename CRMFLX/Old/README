It seems CRMFLX_ver23a is the most stable version.

f77 runcrm.f /data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRMFLX/CRMFLX_ver23a/CRMFLX_V23A_EXP.f -o runcrm

>>> Binary data compatibility <<<
---------------------------------

CRMFLX_V23A_EXP.f needs three binary data files which are machine dependent.
if you need to recompile runcrm.f on none linux machine, you need to do the following.

    1. go to linux machine (this version is complined on linux)

    2. compile SolWB2A.f and run it. this will create an ascii version
       (SolWB2A.f can be found in /data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRM2/v26apr2004/crmflx_v23/)

    3. go to a new machine/operaiton system.

    4. compile SolWA2B.f and run it. this will create a binary version
       which can be read on the new machine.

    5. do same for two others. If you can't find a fortran program, specificlally
       to that data, just modify  SolWB2A.f and/or  SolWA2B.f

 The binary data files are:

    MSheath_Kp_PROT.BIN
    MSPH_Kp_PROT.BIN
    SolWind_Kp_PROT.BIN

The ascii versions are already in:
/data/mta4/Space_Weather/CRMFLX/Data/ (see *.ASC)
